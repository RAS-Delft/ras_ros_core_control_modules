# ras-ros-core-control-modules
ras-ros-core-control-modules is a collection of core components specifically designed to serve as the foundational building blocks for implementing automated vessel control systems. Built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS), this repository encapsulates a suite of essential modules that enable the development of versatile and adaptable vessel control solutions developed in the Researchlab Autonomous Shipping (RAS) Delft.

Unlike repositories focused on project-specific software, ras-ros-core-control-modules emphasizes the creation of universally applicable tools that can be integrated into various maritime automation projects.
